this project is pretty dumb, so I'm probably not going to be working on it anymore than what is already here.

the F3D files are available in the models folders.

The generator thing is what I used for prototyping and testing the geometry I liked.  The other folder has the keyboard in full.

I don't think I remembered to export the plate files, but you can grab them from the F3D.
